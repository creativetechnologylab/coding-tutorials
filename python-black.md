# Tidying Your Python Files with `black` and `isort`

## Using `black`

Black is a popular code formatting tool for Python that helps you maintain a consistent and readable code style. It automatically reformats your code according to PEP 8 style guidelines and enforces a consistent code style across your entire project. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of installing and using Black to tidy up your Python code.

### Installation

To get started, you need to install Black. You can use pip to install it:

```bash
pip install black
```

### Usage

After installing Black, you can use it to format your Python code. To format a single file, you can simply run:

```bash
black your_file.py
```

To format an entire directory, you can use the following command:

```bash
black your_directory/
```

Black will automatically scan your Python files, format them, and overwrite the original files. It doesn't prompt for confirmation, so make sure to back up your code if needed.

### Customizing Black

Black comes with a default set of formatting rules that align with PEP 8, but you can customize its behavior by using configuration files or command-line options.

#### Configuration Files

You can create a `pyproject.toml` file in your project's root directory to specify Black's configuration. Here's an example of a `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 79
target-version = ['py36']
exclude = '\.venv|_build|tmp/'
```

In this example, we've set the line length to 79 characters and specified Python 3.6 as the target version. You can also exclude certain directories or files from being formatted by using regular expressions.

#### Command-Line Options

Black provides several command-line options that allow you to control its behavior. For example, you can set the line length with the `--line-length` option:

```bash
black --line-length 100 your_file.py
```

You can run `black --help` to see a list of all available options.

### Integrating with VSCode

You can use the [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) extension to automatically format your code as you write.

### Conclusion

Black is a powerful tool for ensuring consistent code formatting in your Python projects. By following the installation and usage instructions in this tutorial, you can easily integrate Black into your workflow and maintain a clean and readable codebase. Remember to configure it according to your project's specific requirements to make it work seamlessly with your coding style.

## Using `isort`

Certainly! isort is another popular Python tool that helps you organize and sort your import statements according to PEP 8 guidelines. It's especially useful for ensuring a consistent and clean import structure in your Python code. In this tutorial, we'll cover the installation and usage of isort.

### Installation

You can install isort using pip:

```bash
pip install isort
```

### Usage

Using isort is straightforward. You can format a single file or an entire directory. Here's how to format a single file:

```bash
isort your_file.py
```

To format an entire directory, you can run:

```bash
isort your_directory/
```

By default, isort will automatically sort and organize your import statements within the specified file or directory.

### Customizing isort

isort provides various configuration options to tailor its behavior to your project's specific needs. You can create an `isort.cfg` file in your project's root directory to specify your configuration. Here's an example of an `isort.cfg` file:

```ini
[isort]
line_length = 88
multi_line_output = 3
known_third_party = requests
known_first_party = mymodule
default_section = THIRDPARTY
```

In this example:

- `line_length` sets the maximum line length for your imports.
- `multi_line_output` specifies how multiple imports should be displayed.
- `known_third_party` lists third-party libraries you want to treat as external.
- `known_first_party` lists the modules or packages that belong to your project.
- `default_section` specifies where to place imports that don't match any other section.

You can customize these options and more in your `isort.cfg` file. Run `isort --help` to see a list of available configuration options and their descriptions.

### Integrating with VSCode

The [isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort) extension allows you to automatically format your imports in VSCode.

### Conclusion

isort is a valuable tool for keeping your Python import statements well-organized and compliant with PEP 8 standards. By following the installation and usage guidelines in this tutorial and customizing it as needed, you can maintain a clean and readable import structure in your Python projects. Additionally, integrating isort with your preferred code editor or IDE can make the process even more convenient.
